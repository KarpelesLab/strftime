# strftime

Fast strftime in Go with [BCP 47 language tags](https://golang.org/x/text/language).

# Usage

It is either possible to instanciate an object for a given locale (via `strftime.New`) or directly call strftime.Format().

## Examples

To simply get a timestamp in English:

```go
fmt.Printf("%s: something happened", strftime.EnFormat(`%c`, time.Now()));
```

Or get a quick result in French:

```go
fmt.Printf("%s: Quelque chose est arriv√©", strftime.Format(language.French, `%c`, time.Now()));
```

Or display a result in the appropriate language for a web user:

```go
tags, _, _ := language.ParseAcceptLanguage(r.Header.Get("Accept-Language"))
f := strftime.New(tags...)
f.FormatF(w, `%c`, time.Now());
```

# Description

This version of strftime for Go has multiple goals in mind:

* Support for [BCP 47 language tags](https://golang.org/x/text/language)
* Easy to use
* Ability to just return string or write to a io.Writer
* Be as complete as possible in terms of conversion specifications

| %V      | the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (01-53) |
| %v      | equivalent to %e-%b-%Y |
| %W      | the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53) |
| %w      | the weekday (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (0-6) |
| %X      | national representation of the time |
| %x      | national representation of the date |
| %Y      | the year with century as a decimal number |

| %Z      | the time zone name |
| %z      | the time zone offset from UTC |
| %%      | a '%' |

Era modifiers are available. For locales in which there is no era, normal values (without era modifier) are returned.

| pattern | description |
|:--------|:------------|
| %Ec     | national representation of time and date |
| %EC     | name of era the date is in |
| %EX     | national representation of the time |
| %Ex     | national representation of the date |
| %EY     | full era name and year represented in locale |
| %Ey     | year as decimal number in era (if any) or same as %y |

This library is much faster than other libraries for common cases. In case of format pattern re-use, [Lestrrat's implementation](https://github.com/lestrrat-go/strftime) is still faster (but has no locale awareness).

Please note that this benchmark only uses the subset of conversion specifications that are supported by *ALL* of the libraries compared.

## Internals

This strftime implementation works by writing to a io.Writer by default. If using Format instead of FormatF, it will write internally to a buffer, which is then returned as string.

Go provides two methods to accomplish this starting go 1.10: bytes.Buffer (available in earlier versions) or the new strings.Builder. In go 1.10 strings.Builder is still a bit slow, bug go 1.11 benchmark gets much closer to bytes.Buffer, with slightly less memory usage (208 B/op with strings.Builder vs 227 B/op with bytes.Buffer).

Because of this, it has been decided to stay with bytes.Buffer for now, but tests will have to be run again with new Go versions.
